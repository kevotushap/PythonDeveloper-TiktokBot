## Overview

PythonDeveloper-TiktokBot is a Python-based bot designed to automate TikTok account creation, warm-up, and mass posting. This project utilizes proxies to avoid bans and CAPTCHA bypass services to handle verification challenges.

## Creating Accounts

The bot will create TikTok accounts using the proxies listed in `proxies.txt` and save the credentials in `created_accounts.txt`.

## Warming Up Accounts

After creating the accounts, the bot will warm them up by interacting with TikTok videos.

## Mass Posting

Once the accounts are warmed up, use the mass posting functionality to post content to multiple accounts.

## Configuration

- **Proxies**: Manage proxies in `proxies.txt`.
- **Account Credentials**: Stored in `created_accounts.txt`.
- **CAPTCHA Bypass**: Configure API details in `captcha_bypass.py`.
